In this folder, you will find the Python script to generate the routes, the routes used for the section 4 in the geojson format and a shapefile version obtained in QGIS 
(it goes a lot faster)

You will also find a R markdown file where the data is analysed and all the figures in section 4 are obtainable from this script.
